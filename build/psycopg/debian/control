Description: Python module for PostgreSQL [dummy package]
 psycopg is a PostgreSQL database adapter for the Python programming language
 (just like pygresql and popy.) It was written from scratch with the aim of
 being very small and fast, and stable as a rock. The main advantages of
 psycopg are that it supports the full Python DBAPI-2.0 and being thread safe 
 at level 2. psycopg is different from the other database adapter because it 
 was designed for heavily multi-threaded applications. It also includes some
 extensions to the standard DBAPI-2.0 to allow for better thread performance.
 .
 This dummy package just depends on the right, default version of Python 
 and psycopg.
